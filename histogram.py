Phyllis helped me with this function and my understanding of it SO MUCH!! Thank you, Phyllis!

Does these problems still need to be done? (problem is below)
'''
# 1. histogram() function that takes text and stores each
# word along with the frequency of that word
# WHAT IS THE MOST/LEAST FREQUENT WORD?

# 2. unique_words() takes histogram() argument and returns the total
# number of unique words in a the histogram
# HOW MANY DIFFERENT WORDS ARE USED?
