What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?

yes, they are in their own files and modular

Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?

yes, but this could be improved.

What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?

Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?

they are small and specified, but I do now know

Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?
Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?
Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?
